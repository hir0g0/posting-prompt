        <p>Join us in going for three this March with March Madness, Women's History Month and International Women's Day. This year we're recognizing women from various fields across our products â€” starting with Google TV and the NCAA Women's Tournament.</p>
        <p>This year, all eyes are on the women's tournament, and for good reason. <a href="#">Google Trends</a> shows NCAA Division I Women's Basketball hit an all-time high last year, a trend powered by stars like Caitlin Clark who continues to break records and capture fans.</p>
        <p>To celebrate this year's tournament, Google TV is offering a special hub dedicated to women's basketball games, documentaries and highlights. Simply say "women's basketball" to your Google TV device to access all the content in one place.</p>
        <p>But our celebration extends beyond sports. Throughout March, Google Play will feature collections highlighting women creators across apps, games, books, and movies. YouTube is showcasing playlists curated by women artists and creators who are breaking barriers in their fields.</p>
        <p>International Women's Day on March 8 will feature special collections across all our platforms, highlighting the achievements of women throughout history and in contemporary society.</p>
        <p>We're proud to provide platforms where women's voices can be amplified and their achievements celebrated. Join us this March in recognizing and honoring the contributions of women across all fields.</p>
